<h1 align="center"> Minimal webpack structure (React App) </h1>

The goal is to create a production ready react app without the use of create-react-app that can be used on multiple projects.

## To avoid the hassle that occurs with create-react-app that is:
1. Setting environment varibales everytime
2. Being able to add styling other than css could be sass/scss
3. Avoid using dependencies that one does not really need while developing small scale applications 
4. Decrease bundle size.

## Not yet decided
1. Adding service workers
2. Adding PWA capabilities
3. Managing tests
